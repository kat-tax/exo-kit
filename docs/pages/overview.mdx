# Overview

**EXO KIT** is a collection of libraries for React Native that work on Web, Android, iOS, MacOS, and Windows.

In the React Native ecosystem, it can be hard to find the best library that works for each platform. It's also difficult to maintain compatibility with multiple libraries.

**This library aims to solve that complexity.** It's a curation of the most performant and maintained libraries from the community. It also fills gaps in platform support and provides a consistent and unified API.
