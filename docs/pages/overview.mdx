# Overview

EXO is a collection of libraries for React Native that work on Web, Android, iOS, MacOS, and Windows.

In the React Native ecosystem, it can be hard to find the best library for each platform. It's also difficult to maintain compatibility with multiple libraries.

**The solution to that complexity is EXO.** It's a curation of the most performant and maintained libraries from the community. It also fills gaps in platform support and provides a consistent and unified API.
