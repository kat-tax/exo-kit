# Installation

You can integrate any EXO primitive, component, hook, or utility in any existing React Native project. Tree shaking ensures that only what you use is included in your final bundle.

### Install

First, install `react-exo` as a dependency in your project. Note that any unused export will not be included in your final bundle.

pnpm i react-exo
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add react-exo
```

```sh [bun]

### Import

Once installed, you can now import and use any of the available exports as instructed throughout the documentation.
